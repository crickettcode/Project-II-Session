# H1 Session SkatePark App

> I orginally designed this app for my son and I to use. We go skating often and like to try out different parks. I thought that it would be cool and useful to have a way to collect data from each park that would allow a user (skater) to access the daily activity of a park without physically having to visit each one. As a parent, I like to take my son skating when things are less busy and there are more kids in his age range. 
Every skater has their own preferences and an app like this could help with the flow of traffic within each park. 

> Right now the app allows the user to access several parks and provides a photo and information about each one. Each park also has user profiles that can be updated with general information and whether the user is a skater, has a scooter, or rides BMX. This would also be helpful with the flow and vibe of the park at a given time of the day. Each park also has its own section for user comments and park announcements.
