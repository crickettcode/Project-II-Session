# Session SkatePark App

>I orginally designed this app for my son and I to use. We go skating often and like to try out different parks. I thought that it would be cool and useful to have a way to collect data from each park that would allow a user (skater) to access the daily activity of a park without physically having to visit each one. As a parent, I like to take my son skating when things are less busy and there are more kids in his age range. 
>Every skater has their own preferences and an app like this could help with the flow of traffic within each park. 

>Right now the app allows the user to access several parks and provides a photo and information about each one. Each park also has user profiles that can be updated with general information and whether the user is a skater, has a scooter, or rides BMX. This would also be helpful with the flow and vibe of the park at a given time of the day. Each park also has its own section for user comments and park announcements.

# My Approach - Unsolved Problems - Takeaways

> The approach that I took to this project was to tackle a large project with small steps. I used trello to help me do this and to keep me on task. I find that this method keeps me from becoming overwhelmed, especially early on in the project. As far as my actual application went, I began with my main route and full CRUD and then working my way out to build my other two routes.
> A few of the unsolved problems are my limitations with CSS and continuing to gain a better understanding of routes and the use of Express as a whole. I also would like to become more agile with the entire process of building my applications. 
> My takeaways from Project II were actually that **I really enjoyed it, despite the level of difficulty.** It further solidified that my decision to pursue web development was the right choice and made me even more excited for what lies ahead on my career path. I really do love the ability to create and continue to become more passionate about development each day.
